            <h1>New or Small Business Offer</h1>
            <P>
                Our NoS business offer allows new and small businesses with a low budget to get online fast without any depreciation in quality of end product at a rock bottom price.

                    We know starting a new business or running a small one is tough, so spending a high sum on a flashy website probably isn't the biggest priority. Knowing that, we thought we'd make it a bit easier for you.
                    The NoS business offer will get your business a bespoke 8 page website theme'd with you in mind and is built to directly engage your customer base and demographic. 
                    The site itself will be hosted by us for free for one year, and as part of the offer will be maintained by us for 3 months free of charge.
                    Once the 3 month marker has passed we can offer a range of support contracts for site maintenance.
